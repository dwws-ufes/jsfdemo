manageMyObjects.text.explanation.simple = This is the simplest example of a CRUD. All objects are loaded when the listing is opened and pagination happens in the front-end. There is a global filter field and the table can be ordered by any given column. The form to create or update an object is shown in a dialog.
manageMyObjects.text.explanation.lazy = This is the lazy CRUD example, i.e., pagination happens in the back-end. When first opened, only the first N (e.g. 10) objects are loaded from the back-end and more objects are loaded once you switch pages. In this example, filtering can be done for each separate column. The form to create or update an object is shown in a dialog, like in the simple example.
manageMyObjects.text.explanation.separatedForm = This is the CRUD with separate listing and form panels (i.e., the form is no longer in a dialog). The listing is the same as the simple example, but the form to create or update objects now replaces the listing when opened, in order to accommodate bigger, more complex forms.
manageMyObjects.text.updateSucceeded = My Object updated: 

createNewObject.info.createSuccessful = My Object "{0}" successfully created.
